Defending champion Tadej Pogacar beat Jonas Vingegaard in a thrilling finish to stage seven as he extended his overall lead at the Tour de France.
Pogacar surged past the Dane in the last 20 metres as he claimed his second consecutive stage victory.
Lennard Kamna had looked set to win but Pogacar and Vingegaard swept by on final section of the punishing climb at La Super Planche des Belles Filles.
Primoz Roglic, the 2020 runner-up, finished third with Kamna fourth.
Britain's Geraint Thomas, who won the Tour in 2018, conceded 14 seconds as he finished alongside the German, but will take heart after being well positioned throughout the concluding 7km climb that culminated with a 24% gradient and a gravel stretch to the line.
The Ineos Grenadiers rider moves to third in the general classification, one minute 10 seconds behind Pogacar and 35 seconds behind Jumbo-Visma's Vingegaard.
Despair for Kamna, delight for Pogacar
Kamna was the sole survivor of an 11-man breakaway on the 176.5km stage from Tomblaine, and appeared capable of holding on for a famous victory until the GC race behind him ignited in the final kilometre.
The Bora-Hansgrohe rider was caught on the final bend as Pogacar attacked, and then saw Vingegaard accelerate past him.
Pogacar's response, fighting back superbly with a kick to line, underlined why he has been installed as favourite to win a third consecutive edition of the race.
"It was really, really difficult, especially in the last part where Jonas [Vingegaard] attacked - he was so strong," said UAE Team Emirates rider Pogacar.
"But I said yeah, my boys were working all day so I had to push to the finish line. It was a really special day.
"We opened a foundation today for cancer research, so I wore special shoes just for today, and I'm really happy and proud to take this win on Planche des Belle Filles."
Britain's Adam Yates remains fourth in the GC standings, with team-mate Tom Pidcock dropping to seventh overall.
While Aleksandr Vlasov, the leader of the Bora-Hansgrohe team and American Neilson Powless of EF Education-EasyPost who had started the stage second overall, lost significant ground, Roglic's performance, two days after he dislocated his shoulder on stage five, sees him climb 15 places to 13th overall.
